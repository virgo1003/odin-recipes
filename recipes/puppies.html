    <h2>Forget about deep frying, and give your hush puppies a light update using an air fryer. They're just a bit denser in texture than deep frying, and look for a subtle hint of heat. They're the perfect sidekick to fried fish or shrimp, but they're equally good with a drizzle of honey.</h2>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>nonfat cooking spray</li>
        <li>1 cup yellow cornmeal</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons minced green bell pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup low-fat buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 390 degrees F (198 degrees C) according to manufacturer's instructions. Line the bottom of the air fryer basket with aluminum foil and spray with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Stir cornmeal, flour, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder together in a large bowl. Mix in onion and bell pepper.</li>
        <li>Whisk buttermilk and egg together in a separate bowl. Stir into cornmeal mixture. Let mixture rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drop cornmeal mixture into the foil-lined basket using a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop, making sure not to have them touching each other. Coat with nonfat cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Cook in the preheated air fryer until golden brown, crispy, and cooked through, 9 to 10 minutes. Serve hot.</li>
    </ol>
